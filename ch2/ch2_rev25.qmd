# Ontologic Issues: Thought experiments 

## Thought experiments

-   Philosophers use thought experiments to uncover our intuitions and
    biases about the mind
    -   Framework to identify faulty logical assumptions and knowledge
        gaps
    -   Clears field to set up and characterize a valid problem
    -   Restricted to abstract domain of Concepts and Theory
-   Wikipedia
    -   "A **thought experiment** is a
        [hypothetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis")
        situation in which a
        [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"),
        [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory"),^[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment#cite_note-%C3%98rsted1811-2)^
        or
        [principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle "Principle")
        is laid out for the purpose of thinking through its
        consequences. "

## Quantum States

    cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat "Schrödinger's cat")
    (1935) presents a cat that is in a superposition of alive and dead states, depending on a random
    [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy "Quantum indeterminacy")
    event. It illustrates the counter-intuitive implications of Bohr's
    [Copenhagen
    interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation "Copenhagen interpretation")
    when applied to everyday objects.

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Thought experiments in philosophy are **not** real experiments.
   - “the Chinese Room”
   - “the Trolley Problem” 
   - “Mary the color scientist” 
- Instead, they are narratives or scenarios designed to get us to imagine a situation vividly enough that our intuitions about it come to the surface.

- Intuition Pumps 
   - Can be helpful OR *misleading*. 
   - A well-designed one clarifies thinking and reveals hidden assumptions.

- *In short* 

  - When Dennett calls thought experiments “intuition pumps,” he means they are tools built to elicit and examine our intuitions, which can then be inspected, criticized, and either refined or discarded in the process of philosophical analysis.

    you describe colour to someone without sight?

## The knowledge argument

::: notes
-The following thought experiment was devised by the philosopher Frank
Jackson, and is called the knowledge argument (because Mary, the
protagonist of the story, has complete knowledge of the world but
limited experience of it). Let‚Äôs imagine a woman we call Mary
(Jackson, 1986). Mary has been brought up by an evil philosopher, and
let's call him Frank. - Before opening her eyes at birth, Mary was given
a special pair of contact lenses that turns the world monochrome, so
that she only ever sees the world in black, white, and shades of grey.

-   Mary devotes her life to studying everything to do with colour
    vision -- the physics of colour, the biology of colour vision, the
    neuroscience of colour vision--and by the time she's thirty-five she
    knows everything there is to know about how humans see colour. It
    might well be that to understand colour vision properly she will
    have to end up learning everything there is to know about the world,
    but Mary is extremely clever and has a phenomenal memory, and plenty
    of time.
-   Then on her thirty-fifth birthday she is given a red rose and her
    contact lenses are taken out. What will Mary say? Will she learn
    anything new about colour, or not? Will she be surprised?

## Mary the Color Scientist

1\. How does the 'Mary' color thought experiment make us rethink the
idea that all knowledge comes from physical facts? Do you think science
alone can fully explain consciousness or does Mary’s experience suggest
there’s something more going on?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
2. Why do you think Mary’s first experience of seeing color is such a
big deal for understanding consciousness? What’s the difference between
knowing something in theory and actually experiencing it? Can you argue
that although Mary spent her life studying colors, she didn't know
everything there was to know about color?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
3. How does the 'Mary" color thought experiment highlight the difficulty
in explaining qualia (subjective experiences) using only physical
factors?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
4. If Mary had devoted her life to studying consciousness, do you think
she would have a different understanding of consciousness?

## Mary the Color Scientist {.scrollable .smaller}

| Argument | Supports Dualism | Supports Monism |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| The "Mary" Colour Experiment | If Mary learns something new upon seeing color, it suggests that subjective experience (qualia) is not fully captured by physical explanations. | If Mary doesn't learn anything new, it suggests that complete physical knowledge is sufficient to account for subjective experiences. |
| Dennett's Counterargument    | N/A              | Dennett argues that Mary would not be surprised, suggesting that subjective experiences can be fully understood through physical properties. |
| Knowledge by Description vs Knowledge by Acquaintance | N/A | Churchland uses Bertrand Russell's distinction to argue that while Mary might gain a new form of knowledge (by acquaintance), this doesn't necessarily introduce new facts beyond physical explanations. |
| Experience as Part of Knowledge | Some argue that Mary couldn't possibly know everything about the world without experiential knowledge, which could be seen as a point against materialist monism. | N/A |
| The Hard Problem of Consciousness | The inability of materialist monism to solve the "hard problem" (how physical matter gives rise to subjective experience) can be seen as a point in favor of dualism. | Some argue that the "hard problem" might be an artifact of our current understanding and could be solved within a monist framework. |

## Inverted Color Spectrum {.scrollable .smaller}

| Argument | Supports Dualism | Supports Monism |
|-----|------------------|-----------------|
| Inverted Spectrum Argument   | The idea that people could experience colors differently (e.g., your red is my green) and that this is undetectable suggests that subjective experiences (qualia) are not fully captured by physical explanations. | If it's possible to detect inversion behaviorally by asking people to make judgments about small differences in colors, then the physicalist view that all experiences can be explained physically is supported. |
| Hofstadter's Critique        | N/A              | Hofstadter argues that the inverted spectrum argument is incoherent and that experiences are not detached from the physical brain or the world. This supports a monist view. |
| Asymmetries in Color Space   | N/A              | The existence of asymmetries in color space could make it impossible to find an inversion that is behaviorally undetectable, supporting the idea that experiences can be fully explained physically. |
| Neuroscience of Vision       | The argument that neuroscience can't tell us what we feel when we see red could be seen as a point in favor of dualism. | If neuroscience can eventually explain what we feel when we see colors, this would support monism. |
| Relation to Other Colors     | The idea that something is left over about the "redness of red" and the "greenness of green" that isn't captured by their relation to other colors could be seen as a point in favor of dualism. | If the experience of colors can be fully described in terms of their relations to other colors and their positions in color space, this would support monism. |

# Ontologic Issues: Mind-Brain Problem

## Dualism vs Monism {.scrollable .smaller}

| Emergentism | N/A | A form of property dualism; mental properties emerge when matter is organized in certain complex ways. |
| Idealism | N/A | Proposes that the world is fundamentally mental; material objects exist only in the mind. |

## Mysterianism

-   The problem of consciousness is too complex for our (human) minds
-   It is like Beau the poodle trying to understand the nature of
    language and grammar: it is beyond the capabilities of his brain

## What is it like to be a worm? (302 Neurons)

## Summary

-   What is the difference between mind and brain?
-   The hard problem is why does it feel like something to be you
-   How can the feeling of something, mind, arise from a purely physical
    system?
-   How many types of substance are there?
-   Does materialism / physicalism completely describe the universe?
