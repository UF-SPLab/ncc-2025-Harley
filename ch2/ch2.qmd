## Thought experiments

-   Philosophers use thought experiments to uncover our intuitions and
    biases about the mind
    -   Framework to identify faulty logical assumptions and knowledge
        gaps
    -   Clears field to set up and characterize a valid problem
    -   Restricted to abstract domain of Concepts and Theory
-   Wikipedia
    -   "A **thought experiment** is a
        [hypothetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis")
        situation in which a
        [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"),
        [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory"),^[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment#cite_note-%C3%98rsted1811-2)^
        or

        is laid out for the purpose of thinking through its
        consequences. "

[^1]: [Schrödinger's
    cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat "Schrödinger's cat")
    (1935) presents a cat that is in a superposition of alive and dead
    states, depending on a random
    [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy "Quantum indeterminacy")
    event. It illustrates the counter-intuitive implications of Bohr's
    [Copenhagen
    interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation "Copenhagen interpretation")
    when applied to everyday objects.

## The mind and the brain

-   The mind-brain problem
    -   defines relationships between physical and mental events
-   How do mental states arise from a physical brain?

## The mereological fallacy

-   Does saying “My brain feels pain” make sense?

-   What about “the brain recognizes words”?

-   Paul Nunez will have much more to say about the issues of
    parts/wholes and what is top/bottom

[Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/index.html)
Mereology (from the Greek μερος, ‘part’) is the theory of parthood
relations: of the relations of part to whole and the relations of part
to part within a whole)
:::

## Qualia

-   The subjective quality of perceptions
-   Sensations
    -   The colour red
    -   The smell of a rose
    -   The feeling of pain
-   How would you describe “red” to someone else?

## Try this: Describing red

-   Choose something with prominent qualia, such as a red rose (see
    figure 2.1). How would you describe it to someone else? How would
    you describe colour to someone without sight?

## 

## Try this: How many qualia?

-   Stop and consider your environment.
-   How many qualia can you become aware of?
-   Can you be aware of more than one at a time?

# Ontologic Issues

## Dualism and monism

-   René Descartes and substance dualism (Cartesian dualism)
    -   Res cogitans and Res extensa
-   Other types of dualism
-   Monism (several kinds?)

## Dualism

-   There are two types of substance
    -   Mind and matter
    -   But how do they interact?

## Monism

-   There is one type of matter
    -   Usually physical monism and matter
        -   But doesn’t have to be
-   How does physical matter give rise to subjective experience?

## The knowledge argument

![](DALL·E%202024-08-15%2013.11.49%20-%20A%20before%20and%20after%20image%20illustrating%20the%20concept%20of%20qualia,%20particularly%20the%20experience%20of%20Mary%20The%20Color%20Scientist%20gaining%20color%20vision.%20The%20left%20si.webp)

::: notes
-The following thought experiment was devised by the philosopher Frank
Jackson, and is called the knowledge argument (because Mary, the
protagonist of the story, has complete knowledge of the world but
limited experience of it). Let‚Äôs imagine a woman we call Mary
(Jackson, 1986). Mary has been brought up by an evil philosopher, and
let's call him Frank. - Before opening her eyes at birth, Mary was given
a special pair of contact lenses that turns the world monochrome, so
that she only ever sees the world in black, white, and shades of grey.

-   Mary devotes her life to studying everything to do with colour
    vision -- the physics of colour, the biology of colour vision, the
    neuroscience of colour vision--and by the time she's thirty-five she
    knows everything there is to know about how humans see colour. It
    might well be that to understand colour vision properly she will
    have to end up learning everything there is to know about the world,
    but Mary is extremely clever and has a phenomenal memory, and plenty
    of time.
-   Then on her thirty-fifth birthday she is given a red rose and her
    contact lenses are taken out. What will Mary say? Will she learn
    anything new about colour, or not? Will she be surprised?

## Mary the Color Scientist

1\. How does the 'Mary' color thought experiment make us rethink the
idea that all knowledge comes from physical facts? Do you think science
alone can fully explain consciousness or does Mary’s experience suggest
there’s something more going on?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
2. Why do you think Mary’s first experience of seeing color is such a
big deal for understanding consciousness? What’s the difference between
knowing something in theory and actually experiencing it? Can you argue
that although Mary spent her life studying colors, she didn't know
everything there was to know about color?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
3. How does the 'Mary" color thought experiment highlight the difficulty
in explaining qualia (subjective experiences) using only physical
factors?

## Mary the Color Scientist

\
4. If Mary had devoted her life to studying consciousness, do you think
she would have a different understanding of consciousness?

## Mary the Color Scientist

(Explaining implicit "knowledge" that comes directly from experience.)

## The inverted colour spectrum

-   Could you “see” violet when I “see” red?

## Dualism vs Monism {.scrollable}

| Topic/Concept/Thought Experiment | Dualism | Monism |
|----|----|----|
| Substance Dualism | Proposes that mind and matter are fundamentally different substances. Fits well with intuitive experiences and beliefs about the soul. | N/A |
| Problems with Substance Dualism | Faces the issue of how mind and matter interact; also, mental material is not accessible through physical or scientific methods. | N/A |
| Parallelism and Occasionalism | Attempts to explain the interaction between mind and matter through divine intervention. | N/A |
| Property Dualism | Introduces the concept that there is one substance but two kinds of properties: physical and mental. | N/A |
| Emergentism | N/A | A form of property dualism; mental properties emerge when matter is organized in certain complex ways. |
| Idealism | N/A | Proposes that the world is fundamentally mental; material objects exist only in the mind. |
| Materialism/Physicalism | N/A | Proposes that only physical matter exists, governed by the laws of physics. |
| Neutral Monism | N/A | Suggests that mind and matter are different aspects of a single substance. |
| The "Mary" Colour Experiment | Supports the idea that subjective experience (qualia) cannot be fully explained by physical properties alone. | Challenges materialism by suggesting that complete physical knowledge is insufficient to account for subjective experience. |
| Dennett's Counterargument | N/A | Argues that complete knowledge would indeed prepare Mary for the experience of color, thus no "hard problem" exists. |
| Churchland's Argument | N/A | Suggests that experience offers a different kind of knowledge ("knowledge-by-acquaintance") but doesn't necessarily introduce new facts. |

## Intro

\
We'll explore consciousness through three exercises. First, in a
**Turing Test**, one of you will convince another that you're conscious.
Next, in a **Reverse Turing Test**, you'll argue that one student
(playing as ChatGPT) is conscious while the other denies it. Lastly, a
**three-person version** will involve one student playing ChatGPT,
another arguing they're conscious, and a third evaluating the debate.
These activities will help to assess and better understand how we
recognize and argue for consciousness, using reasoning from Chapter 2.\

## **Regular Turing Test Exercise:**

Choose a partner who’s role is to convince ChatGPT (the other student
role-playing) that they are conscious.

    Sample questions:

        "How would you prove that you're experiencing something right
now? Can you describe it?"

        "What differentiates your thoughts from a machine’s programmed
responses?"

        "If I claim you’re just responding based on learned behavior,
how would you disprove that?"

## 

**Reverse Turing Test Exercise:**

Take turns trying to convince the other that you are conscious. The
other’s role is to deny their claims.

    Sample questions:

        "What observable behaviors or qualities make someone conscious?
How do you know I have those?"

        "Is there any objective evidence that proves consciousness, or
is it purely subjective?"

        "If I deny being conscious, how would you refute that without
relying on my own descriptions?"

## 

**Three-Person Version:**

One student is ChatGPT, another argues that the first student is
conscious, and a third student assesses both sides, determining who has
the stronger argument.

    Questions:

        "What observable behaviors would lead you to conclude someone is
conscious?"

        "How does language or behavior play into our assumptions about
consciousness in others?"

        "If two people disagree on someone else’s consciousness, how can
we resolve that disagreement?"

## The problem of pain

-   The physical aspect of pain
-   The mental aspect of pain
-   Pain in babies (27 weeks is gestation; 2nd trimester)

## P-ZOMBIES

-   Philosophical zombies

    -   Could we have a creature that appears in every way to be
        conscious, but isn’t?

-   Is consciousness essential?

-   Being conceivable

::: notes
:::

## Materialism

-   A type of monism
-   All there is is matter
-   Physics captures everything

## More materialism

-   Reductive materialism

-   Eliminative materialism

    -   Getting rid of the problem of qualia
    -   A trick of how we think and speak

::: notes
:::

## Functionalism

-   Silicon neurons and silicon brains
-   The "China brain" thought experiment
    -   Can the population of China signal and act like a brain?
    -   *Conversely*: can a neuron be conscious?

::: notes
-   what's necessary for a function?
-   What are some problems with this?
-   There is a lot about a nation that is like an organism. What about
    our def of the function of consciousness might be comparable?

# Epistemic Issues

## Neurons

![](Trevor%20A.%20Harley_fig.%202_10.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="100"
height="300"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The brain has about 100 billion neurons.
-   Each neuron might be connected to about 1000 others.
-   Does consciousness really arise from just a lot of these connected
    together?
:::

::: notes
Figure 2.10. A neuron. A nerve cell - the brain has about 100 billion of
them, and each neuron might be connected to a 1000 others. Does
consciousness really arise from just a lot of these connected together?
:::

## Arguments against functionalism

-   Searle and the Chinese room
-   All syntax and no semantics
-   Is the “systems reply” adequate?

::: notes
-   I can navigate anywhere in Gainesville if I have GPS and Google
    maps. Limited number of places w/o phone. Does this mean that I
    don't know how to navigate?
-   The cockpit of the plane that Captain Sully flew was arranged to
    make it possible for him to land the plane on the Hudson. Does this
    mean that the plane saved the day?
:::

## Mysterianism

-   The problem of consciousness is too complex for our (human) minds
-   It is like Beau the poodle trying to understand the nature of
    language and grammar: it is beyond the capabilities of his brain

## Summary

-   What is the difference between mind and brain?
-   The hard problem is why does it feel like something to be you
-   How can the feeling of something, mind, arise from a purely physical
    system?
-   How many types of substance are there?
-   Does materialism / physicalism completely describe the universe?
