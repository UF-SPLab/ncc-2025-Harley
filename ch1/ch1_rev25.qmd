## Defining consciousness

-   What is it like to be me?
-   Why does it feel like something to be me?
-   Awareness v self-awareness
-   Awareness of being aware

# Science of Consciousness

## The problem of other minds

-   We know what it is like to be ourselves
-   But our experiences are private
-   What is it like to be something else?

## Thomas Nagel {.scrollable background-color="black"}

"What is it like to be a bat?" (1974)

Bats use echolocation. Can we appreciate what it is like to be a bat?

> According to a Japanese dictionary, 'art' is defined as 'human activities or works of art that attempt to create and express beauty by means of special materials, methods or forms.' In this light, it is questionable whether these pieces, a series of drawings on writing pads with no regards to techniques or an aesthetic sense, can be readily treated as art pieces. Rather, they may be more appropriately seen as an illustrated journal of his psychiatric symptoms.

> However, this illustrated journal on symptoms offers a compelling charm beyond expression. One gazes at this illustrated journal and starts to imagine and experience his psychiatric symptoms as he might have gone through them. In clinical psychiatric practice, treatment often reaches a turning point when a patient's inner world and suffering, which are both hard to communicate by words, are visualized and then relived and understood by the family and the therapist.

> After a head injury due to a fall at work, the patient had become delusional and hallucinatory, which had likely been exacerbated by alcohol abuse; this prompted him to be temporarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Ten years later, he was hospitalized again for delusions and hallucinations triggered by trouble with an inheritance. He received a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder and has been treated as an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital for about 10 years now.

> The patient kept this illustrated journal for over 20 years. In the journal, every drawing was sequentially numbered, revealing that his inner experience had a sense of continuity. When asked about the reason for his drawing, he says: 'Drawing this helps me calm down.' He stopped drawing in 2019, though. 'I have drawn everything,' he explains as to why he stopped. It does not go beyond my imagination, but I suspect that by keeping this journal he has finally come to terms with the symptoms that agonized him for so many years.

## The hard & easy problems of consciousness {background-color="ivory" background-image="gap.jpg" background-size="cover"}

::::: columns

**Hard Problem**

-   why does it feel like *something* to be me?

**"Easy" Problem(s)**

-   spatial attention
-   episodic memory
-   visual perception
-   wakefulness, etc.
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   The hard problem involves explaining **HOW** physical processes produce **subjective** experience (the explanatory gap);

-   “easy” problems concern mechanisms of cognition (access, & report)

-   wake/sleep, attention, memory, control, etc.

-   Views diverge:

    -   some expect the hard problem to dissolve after solving the “easy” ones;

        -   it's possible that when we fully understand all the "easy" parts and how they add togethere and interact we might realize that there's no remaining "hard" problem

    -   others think it will remain or is forever impossible to solve

-   progress so far is mostly on the “easy” problems.

## Philosophy and Consciousness {.smaller}

> Consciousness is entwined with one of the fundamental concerns of philosophical thought, the problem of free will. Harley, p.4

-   What is a "self"? (Is it stable?, permanent?)

-   **Homunculus** or "Cartesian Theater"

    -   Dualist concept that there's a movie screen where all the senses project onto and the human is able to sit and watch.

**Homunculus** or "Cartesian Theater"

-   Dualist concept that there's a movie screen where all the senses project onto and the human is able to sit and watch.

What is a "self"? (Is it stable?, permanent?)

-   Homunculus suffers from "Infine Regress"

## Intentionality: are we always conscious of something?

Often, we do and experience many things more or less reflexively.

-   Can you be conscious but not conscious of something in particular?

-   Volition is related to intentionality

-   Free-will (Ch.3) is related to intentionality

    ::: notes
    -   Consciousness exhibits aboutness (intentionality): it is directed at thoughts, sensations, or bodily states;

    <!-- -->

    -   many processes (digestion, parsing language) remain inaccessible;

    -   skilled performance can degrade under conscious control;

    -   attempts at “pure nothingness” become conscious of nothingness as something.

## Types of consciousness {.smaller}

Phenomenal and Access consciousness (Ned Block)

Experiencing vs. Attention, memory, language, reason

|                  | *Access* | **No**   | Yes     |
|------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| ***Phenomenal*** |          |          |         |
| **No**           |          | Tree     | *Robot* |
| **Yes**          |          | *Rodent* | Human   |
|                  |          |          |         |

: Seperability of Types of Consciousness

::: incremental
Other types of consciousness

-   Self-consciousness (e.g., emotion, identity, narrative, social)
-   Secondary consciousness (e.g., past, future, imagined)
-   Degrees of consciousness
:::

::: notes
-   **Phenomenal consciousness** is what we experience:
    -   it's **what it's like** to be us.
    -   It's the sensations of perception from the outside, and the experience of wanting, thinking, and feeling from the inside.
    -   covered for most of ch 1
    -   for many understanding phenomenal consciousness is the central "hard problem"to be addressed.
-   **Access consciousness** concerns language, thought, controlling action, and reasoning.
    -   Access consciousness concerns **what** we talk and think about, and importantly, it's **what** we *can report*
    -   so it's our thoughts, feelings, and desires themselves(rather than our experience of them) and
    -   the **representations** that are manipulated in cognition.
-   P-consciousness and A-consciousness typically interact but may, in principle, dissociate; debates center on computability and whether A-consciousness belongs under “consciousness” at all.

## A cone of consciousness?

![](Hofstat_cone.png){.absolute top="100" right="200" height="600"}

::: notes
Figure 1.10. Hofstadter's "consciousness cone". Most people think that consciousness is a graded phenomena: some organisms have "more" of it than others. Is this lay belief correct?
